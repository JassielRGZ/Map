This program aims to display active tickets from the hospital's ticketing system on a campus map. The data is exported from the ticketing system as an Excel file, and pins are placed on the map to indicate the number of pending tickets at each location. This visualization helps identify high-need areas and prioritize efforts. In the final version, pins will show the number of tickets at each location and be color-coded based on the average time tickets have been outstanding.
